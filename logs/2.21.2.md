Logistic regression works great overall. Was able get great results + test scoring function (works but we don't know what the noise ceiling so the score might be very different).

TODO:
- Submit asap with current architecture
- Try out using global aggregation as the final layer and completely scrap linear layers
- Most important priority is making sure target distribution closely resembles output distribution
- Continue experimenting with model depth
